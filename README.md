## Dash for UX design testing
[https://dash-ux-design-tester.herokuapp.com/]
This application uses Dash to as way to provide statistical data on a website's UX design quality. In this case, the tested website is called "Yunke's eLibrary" and is a simple online library that allows users to access eBooks and to contact the owner of the business. The main metric used to evaluate the quality of a website is the number of button clicks a user expands to accomplish a desired task. If a website is well designed, then a user should not be wasting clicks to backtrack and to blindly explore the website. In the "Test Results" tab, the orange bar on the bar graph represents the optimal number of button clicks to accomplish one of the three tests, and so the higher the percentage of users manage to pass the tests with the optimal number of button clicks, the better designed the website is.

On the website tab, you have access to the website as well as the testing module, and on the test results tab, you have acess to the graphical data of the accumulated tests. To run a test, simply go on the website tab and press the "Start Test" button and follow the instructions. Once all 3 tests are completed, submit your test results and the data will be updated, along with the graphs. 

In order to improve the app, additional metrics for website design quality would be added, namely time spent on a task.

This app is also hosted on [heroku](https://dash-ux-design-tester.herokuapp.com/).
