## Dash for UX design testing
This application uses Dash to as way to provide statistical data on a website's UX design quality. In this case, the tested website is called "Yunke's eLibrary" and is a simple online library that allows users to access eBooks and to contact the owner of the business.

On the website tab, you have access to the website as well as the testing module, and on the test results tab, you have acess to the graphical data of the accumulated tests. To run a test, simply go on the website tab and press the "Start Test" button and follow the instructions. Once all 3 tests are completed, submit your test results and the data will be updated, along with the graphs. 

This app is also hosted on [heroku](https://dash-ux-design-tester.herokuapp.com/).
